  //Problem #4: Consider a method greatestCommonFactor. What type should it return?
  // What type(s) should it take in? Create the method signature.
  //ANSWER: It should return and take in type long so that it could handle very big integers
  // (since "int" has lower limits). Here is the method signature:
  public static long greatestCommonFactor(long a, long b, long c)
  {//todo write the method body itself?
    return c;
  }
}
