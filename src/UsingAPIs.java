//Exercises:
//
//        Import the HashSet and create a HashSet object.



//        Use a HashSet to figure out how many unique words are in A Tale of Two Cities and Moby Dick, respectively.
//        Feel free to refer back to the Verbosity Calculator assignment.


//        Clean up the code - your HashSet currently thinks "the." and "the" and "The" are all different words!
//        Do some String operations to make your word counts more accurate.


//        Create a set that is the intersection of words between A Tale of Two Cities and Moby Dick.
//        What is the cardinality (size) of this set?


//        Create a set that is the union of words between A Tale of Two Cities and Moby Dick.


//        Create an iterator for the union set.


//        For fun - try this again but with two books from the same author!
